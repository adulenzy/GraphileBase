# GraphileBase

# NOT FOR BEGINNERS
We do not advise that you build your own projects on top of this project until you're comfortable with the various tools it uses (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, PostGraphile, Graphile Worker, Graphile Migrate, TypeScript, React, Apollo Client for React, GraphQL Code Generator, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Cypress, etc).

This is an advanced project with deeply integrated tooling across the full stack. The project is called "Starter" because it helps you to start new projects with all these technologies, tools and techniques already in place. If you're not already familiar with these things then you'll probably find the project overwhelming, it is not intended to be your first experience of any of these tools.
