This is an **advanced** project with deeply integrated tooling across the full
stack. The project is called "Starter" because it helps you to start new
projects with all these technologies, tools and techniques already in place. If
you're not already familiar with these things then you'll probably find the
project overwhelming, it is not intended to be your first experience of any of
these tools.
